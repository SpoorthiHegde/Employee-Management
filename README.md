Build a Spring Boot MVC web application for an Employee Management System featuring CRUD operations:

1. Setup Spring Boot Project:

Create a new Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr.
Include dependencies for Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, Thymeleaf, and H2 Database (or any other database of your choice).

2. Define Entity Class:

Create an Employee class with fields like id, firstName, lastName, email, etc.
Annotate the class with @Entity and define primary key using @Id annotation.
Use appropriate JPA annotations like @Column, @GeneratedValue, etc., for mapping.

3. Create Repository Interface:

Define a repository interface for the Employee entity by extending JpaRepository<Employee, Long>.
This interface will provide CRUD methods for interacting with the database.

4. Implement Service Layer:

Create a service class to encapsulate business logic for CRUD operations.
Autowire the repository interface in the service class and implement methods for CRUD operations.

5. Create Controller Class:

Define a controller class to handle HTTP requests and responses.
Autowire the service class in the controller and define request mapping methods for CRUD operations.
Use @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, and @DeleteMapping annotations for mapping HTTP methods to controller methods.

6. Configure Application Properties:

Configure database connection properties, such as URL, username, password, etc., in the application.properties file.

7. Run and Test Application:

Run the Spring Boot application and navigate to the specified URL (e.g., localhost:8080) in a web browser.
Test CRUD operations by adding, editing, and deleting employees through the web interface.
Verify that changes are reflected in the database and displayed correctly in the UI.

8. Deploy Application:

Package the application as a WAR or JAR file using Maven.
Deploy the application to a web server like Apache Tomcat or run it as a standalone application.
Test the deployed application in a production-like environment to ensure everything works as expected.

This application will allow users to perform basic CRUD operations on employee data through a web interface.
